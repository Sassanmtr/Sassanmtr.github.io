## About
Hi!, I am a Computer Science master's student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Freiburg University. My research revolves around robot manipulation, spanning policy learning methods to computer vision-based approaches. Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis under the guidance of Prof. Abhinav Valada and Eugenio Chisari in the Robot Learning lab, where I utilize Computer Vision-based approaches to tackle the manipulation task for articulated objects. As a research assistant, my primary focus is generating datasets for various computer vision tasks, including object detection, depth estimation, and instance segmentation. 
  Prior to this I mainly considered the theoretical aspects of Applied Mathematics. I was a research assistant in the Mathematics for Uncertainty Quantification group at RWTH Aachen University, analyzing stochastic differential equations. I hold a master's degree in Scientific Computing from Heidelberg University, where I specialized in partial differential equation analysis, and a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Shiraz University.
